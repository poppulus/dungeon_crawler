*** Doomed Looters main characters ***

These are the four main characters I made for Doomed Looters (http://7drl.org/2016/03/15/doomed-looters-success/) - a small 2d action roguelike game and my entry for 2016 edition of 7DRL competition.
I think, despite their defects, they're nice, and they fit well in this kind of game (at least for prototyping).

Each spritesheet has 2 idle frame, 2 walking frame, 3 attacking frame, for down, up and right direction (I used right even for left, just flipping it, even if it's not exactly correct)
Sprites are 32x32 pixels.

I release them with CC BY 3.0 licence (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/) that means you can use them freely, even for commercial purposes, and you can adapt them if you need it.
Only requested things is to credit me:

I hope they can help you in some of your projects. If so, and if you want, drop me a line telling me about your game.
